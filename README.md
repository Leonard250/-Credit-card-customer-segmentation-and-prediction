Credit card issuers face constant challenges in tailoring marketing and risk management strategies to 
diverse customer profiles. With traditional systems falling short, this study aims to develop a dynamic 
and accurate approach for customer segmentation and group prediction. We leverage K-means 
clustering to segment credit card customers based on their financial and transactional pre-processed
data. Subsequently, we utilize Random Forest with cross-validation to predict the segment 
membership of new customers. The dataset used consists of 8950 credit card users and 18 variables. 
K-means clustering identified two distinct segments: active and inactive customers. Feature selection 
identified only seven essential features for prediction. Random Forest cross-validation achieved an F1 
score of 98.7% which improved a bit after feature selection. These techniques provide a reliable and 
efficient method for credit card customer segmentation and group prediction. This offers valuable 
insights for targeted marketing and risk management strategies, tailored to specific customer profiles
